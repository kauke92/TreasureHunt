DB Project Assignment Part 3: Database Programming

GROUP : R13A2

Discussion

One of the extensions we chose to include was Option 1, the ability to rate and review hunts. 
We added a separate page for reviews that allows a user to select which hunt they wish to review from a drop down bar.  
It the displays previous ratings and comments about that hunt, as well as an average rating.  
There is a button that allows you to add your own comment and rating to the hunt as well.


Some of the issues we encountered and suggestions for improvements we received during the tutorial at the half way point were as follows.  
We needed to add appropriate error messages for errors when the player did not have a team, hunt, or incorrect information was passed to the website.  
We also needed to add transactions properly within the code.  
There was also some improvement to be made on the security side of the code, adding stored procedures and such.  

The other extension we implemented was the hunt vistualization.  
On another page, we embedded a google maps viewer that displays each clue’s location as a marker, 
allowing players to see located clues and checkpoints at any time once they have logged in.
